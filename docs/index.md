# My Bluebook

The idea of this mind to disk consciencness was not my own, but from https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book.  It is
amazing the depth and breadth that is presented there.  I am sure that I will not have as much information 
in such topics for a long time.  However, we are always learning and dreaming so that's what this is to me.

So with that the first docs/learning that I am going to save my future self from having to relearn is howe
to start a doc site!

 - [doc site](docs-site)
For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
